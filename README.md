# The Dunk Detector 

Welcome to our CS3200 - Dtabase Design semester project! Our team decided to build a data-driven basketball scouting and analytics application. The Dunk Detector serves as the all-in-one platform for coaches, general managers, data scientists, and scouts to find all the data they need to make informed decisions about their team, players, and game strategies. 

For example, coaches will be able to pull and compare their players' statistics against up and coming rivals or potential recruits to better understand how to develop a solid game startegy and where to best spend their scouting efforts. Similarly, data nalaysts are able to pull information from the statistics table and any other relevant tables to identify team and individual player performance trends and key team statistics. General managers will have access to players contract information and other essential financial data to ensure that the team's budget is being efficiently spent. Lastly, scouts will be able to keep track of highlight players to then generate and upload scout reports that the coaches and GMs can access.  

# How to Run this Application
